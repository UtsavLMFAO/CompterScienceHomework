Hey!
This program will give you somewhat of an overview on every element in the periodic table. 

To run the program:
1. Run the run.py script


If encountering Module error:
Run the HomePage.py file and AnswersPage.py file separately and individually once and try again :)
(Ps: If you know how to fix it please let me know as well..)
